## An MVC Java Game Project in Swing

This project was created as part of the Programming course on the University of Glasgow's MSc Software Development programme.

The goal of the project was to demonstrate an understanding of MVC architectures in Java using Swing. Additionally, it provided an opportunity to apply design patterns such as the Observer pattern and the Template Method pattern.

Further information can be found in the accompanying  documentation:

- The [task specification](AE3%20-%20fruit%20machine%20-%20TASK.pdf) provided by the university.
- JavaDoc comments throughout the code.
